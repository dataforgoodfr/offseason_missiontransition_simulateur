        # We need to mirror the exclusions in setup.cfg because when a file is passed
        # directly to flake8, it ignores the exclusion settings. If we wouldn't do this,
        # editing an excluded file would lead to it being checked anyway, and preventing
        # a commit.

    # Sort imports
    # We do not use the default remote repo in order to avoid de-synchronisation
    # between the installed version and the pre-commit version.
    # Because of this, we might miss some new optimisation. Please check this link for changes:
